# BluishPortfolio template for Nextjs: A statically generated portfolio using Next.js, Markdown, and TypeScript

This project is based on the existing [blog-starter](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/blog-starter) plus TypeScript.

This example showcases Next.js's [Static Generation](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages) feature using Markdown files as the data source.

The projects are stored in `/_projects/{lang}` folder, where {lang} is the locale of the projects, for example, currently the english projects are in `/_projects/en` and the spanish projects in `/_projects/es`, the projects are writed as Markdown files with front matter support. Adding a new Markdown file in there will create a new portfolio's project.

To create the portfolio projects we use [`remark`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark) and [`remark-html`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-html) to convert the Markdown files into an HTML string, and then send it down as a prop to the page. The metadata of every project is handled by [`gray-matter`](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/gray-matter) and also sent in props to the page.

Deploy it to the cloud with [Vercel](https://vercel.com/new?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=next-example) ([Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment)).

### Add a Tag

- Add the tag as enum in src/lib/tag.ts
- Add the svg image of the tag in public/assets/tags/
- Add the tag title in the the file src/lib/tag-helpers.ts.
- That's all, now the tag can be used on any project.

### Favicons

The favicons are auto generated by a script, you just move your portfolio logo to the path: `public/assets/portfolio/`, and the file must have the name: `logo.png`, and that's all, the favicons will be generated on each production build.

### Sitemap.xml

Sitemap.xml file is generated by a script, do not forget upload it to Google Search Console to improve the SEO of your page.

### Table of contents

Remember to update the value of TABLE_OF_CONTENT_KEYWORDS of the Constants file adding all your keywords to find in the project's markdown and insert the table of content.

### Contact form

Remember to create a .env.local file on the root directory and add values for SENDGRID_API_KEY, CONTACT_EMAIL_SENDER and CONTACT_EMAIL_RECEIVER in order to receive the sent emails.

## Notes

- This template uses [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com). To control the generated stylesheet's filesize, this example uses Tailwind CSS' v2.0 [`purge` option](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/controlling-file-size/#removing-unused-css) to remove unused CSS.

- [Tailwind CSS v2.0 no longer supports Node.js 8 or 10](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/upgrading-to-v2#upgrade-to-node-js-12-13-or-higher). To build your CSS you'll need to ensure you are running Node.js 12.13.0 or higher in both your local and CI environments.

- Github found potential security vulnerabilities in the dependencies, that's because `favicons` package use `url-regex ` and `jpeg-js`, packages with potential security vulnerabilities, but there aren't problem with that because `favicons` just run in a script in the build process.
